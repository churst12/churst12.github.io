The summer of 2018 at [Checkbook][checkbook] was packed with so many great experiences and opportunities. First and foremost I'd like to thank the Checkbook team for having me and teaching me so many skills that I will carry for the rest of my career. I have a lot of things to say about my experience so I'll break it up into a few sections.

###### 1. Getting the Job
###### 2. My Work/Responsibilities
###### 3. Obstacles

##### Getting the Job

I know it sounds odd, but both of my summer interships were found through Cragislist. With a community college and no 4-year university on my resume, "cold" applying to companies online and getting interviews was hard. Craigslist puts you right through to the employer and gets a conversation going right away, which helps a lot.

I really liked their interview process. There is something that feels wrong about boiling down years of experience into a 30 minute whiteboard coding interview, so when PJ(founder) told me that I would be working on a mini-project to show off my skills I was thrilled. 

The challenge was to build a text-enabled implementation of the Checkbook API, which required the implementation of a web app to host the calls. I liked this style of interview because it allowed me to showcase my learning agility, and ability for getting stuff done under pressure. Although I knew nothing about web app hosting, the heroku documentation was clean and concise so I was able to produce something and get an offer for the job.

##### My Work/Responsibilities

Being an intern at a startup is wild. Any amount of class work or hackathons could not have prepared me for such a battle. The workflow is blazingly fast, and it all matters. At a startup, all of your work makes a direct influence on the product which can be scary at times, especially for an entry-level Software Engineering Intern. It takes some getting used to, but in the end what really motivates me is seeing that my time and effort is making a difference and that it is valued. 

At a startup, you play a part in many aspects of the company. People do have their own roles, but with so many moving parts and not enough people to go around, you have to learn a wide range of technologies and be able to work with different people to accomplish your tasks. One day you might be working on the frontend with some text placement, and the next you will be diving deep into the backend with a completely new codebase. Although it was challenging, I liked the fact that I always was being pushed and learning new things. 

One example of some of the work I did was helping the sales team generate new leads. Although this was an ongoing process, I had to learn some more advanced SQL and database navgation to get the team what they wanted. After some time, I was able to whip up a python script that queried our database for the user data. When user sign-ups came in, I tracked whether they had sent a check or not, and if they had a private email. These daily sign-ups would then get pushed out to a Sendgrid(emailing service) list, from which the sales team could engage by sending out onboarding emails. Tasks like this helped me visualize the impact of my work, and how I was making a difference. Working with the sales team helped me understand what kind of users were coming in, and who we were selling to as a company.

##### Obstacles

At any job, you are bound to come across some obstacles. So naturally as an entry-level software engineering intern, there were a lot of challenges that I had to overcome. 

One aspect that was hard adjusting to was the fast work environment of the company. One benefit of early stage startups is that they move quickly and push features out effortlessly. This comes at a cost though. Sometimes, when you have a feature to push out with a deadline such as a demo for a prospective client, you have to be creative in order to meet the deadlines ahead which may mean long Fridays and early Saturdays. This was one thing I had trouble with. Balancing my life outside of work with the tasks I had was hard, and it took a while to develop the time management skills to handle everything on my calandar. 

The biggest challenge I faced while at Checkbook however, was the new codebase/technologies and trying to work with them. Stepping into a whole new world with overlapping technologies and products is hard to get used to. At a startup, there are a limited amount of people to help you work on your tasks. This means that while they are there to answer some questions, that you might have to to some digging first. As an intern, it took a little while before I realized that it is ok if I'm taking longer than normal with my tasks, as long as I'm not taking up the time of others. Although it was hard, by the end of summer I was a lot better at finding solutions by myself, and in my opinion is was one the best skills to have built on throughout the whole internship.
