At the end of January, I attended yet another amazing hackathon, CruzHacks. CruzHacks is UCSC's main annual hackathon at the school. It was well organized by the students of UCSC and I would like to congratulate/thank them on putting together a successful and fun hackathon. By the end of it, my team and I were fortunate enough to away with a first-place prize in the "product improvement" category. In this post I'd like to talk about our journey and the problems we faced along the way. I'm going to organize this in the same way as my last post (<a href="http://collinhurst.com/blog/2018-11-06.html" target="_blank">link if you haven't read it</a>), so here is the structure:

###### 1. The Prompt
###### 2. Our Solution
###### 3. Obstacles
###### 4. The Stack/My Role
###### 5. Securing 1st Place
###### 6. What I learned
<br/>

##### The Prompt
The overall theme of the hackathon was to build something innovative-- I know, very broad. However, the real themes were in the prize categories. There were a number of sponsors advocating for their respective prize categories including the "main event" of Tech Innovation, and Tech Cares. Our approach was to think of a project that we all wanted to work on, and tailor it to a few categories. This would allow us to build something we were interested in while not being too restrained by the more specific categories.

##### Our Solution
My team, consisting of Darren Dawson, Akul Goyal, and Adam Filiz, decided to work on something we called "Webcast.DB". In order to understand our product, one has to understand the webcast system that UCSC and many other schools use. Webcast is a product that allows professors to automatically record and upload lectures online. This makes their lectures easily attainable by the enrolled students. 

The problem that most students have, however is that each lecture can be up to 2 hours long and if you want to obtain specific information or snippets you have to scroll through the whole lecture to find it. This makes specific information retrieval frustrating and time consuming. Our solution solves this issue.

(our official description on devpost) Webcast.DB breaks down information from UCSC webcasts and makes it easier to both search through and understand. Each webcast for a class is broken down into individual lectures, and each lecture is broken down into individual slides. Users can go through lecture slides and get summaries of the information from each slide. Additionally, for each slide, users have access to related topics, allowing them to jump to other lectures to seamlessly continue their learning.

This was a great project to work on because of the amount of impact that it could have on students. Making information and knowledge more accessible students allows them to learn faster and more efficiently.

##### Obstacles
This hackathon, my team and I ran into numerous challenges that we had to overcome. First, we realized that one of our main functionalities, a concept-map wouldn't work due to the lack of access to all the classes in the system. This led us to a full pivot to webcast.db.

The main technical challenge however, was the computational challenge of retrieving information from the lectures. Not only would we have to run transcriptions on the lecture audio, but we would have to create summaries out of these transcriptions as well. With so many lectures going online a day, the computational limitations were looming.

To work around this, we found Google APIs that were able to handle large videos and process them into text. We would separate each lecture into the slides, and then pass in the individual videos into the API. We would then run a machine learning model on the text to create summaries and bullet points that would portray the information correctly. After retrieving the summaries and bullets, we were free to organize and present our findings however we liked on the website, which was a huge relief.

##### The Stack/My Role
I seem to be finding my niche in hackathons-- the backend. After separating tasks I found myself building yet another API, which is something that is familiar to me and importantly so with a mere 30 hours of time. We built the backend with python/flask, and the frontend with React. Our servers and API calls were all from the google cloud, where we were using many of their products. Of course, we also worked with scraping the Webcast website, which is a subsidiary of Opencast.

##### Securing 1st Place
Over the course of the hackathon, we truly believed we had a shot at some of the prizes. Our product seemed helpful to many students and we were able to build it well enough to portray the main functionalities of our product. The main categories that we were shooting for were: Best use of the Google Cloud Platform (Google), Best Product Improvement (ProductOps), and Tech Innovation (CruzHacks). 

We definitely kept this in mind as we headed into our pitches. At Cruzhacks, we had a table and various judges would come by to talk and demo our product. As we would give our pitch to the judge, we would keep in mind what company/category they were from, and tailor the pitch to that category. I think that in the end this is what allowed us to take 1st place in Product Improvement.

##### What I learned
At the end of the day the least you want to come out with is new knowledge and experience with product building. Throughout this hackathon, one of the main things I learned was how to change and adapt to the expectations that come your way. Nothing is ever built exactly the way it was drawn up the first time, you have to learn to be flexible in your endeavors in order to reach the end goal. I hope to bring this new knowledge to future hackathons and with any of my goals in the future. I look forward to attending CruzHacks next year and hope it will be as fulfilling as this years.
