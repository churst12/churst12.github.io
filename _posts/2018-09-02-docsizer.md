Coming out of my [first job][fjob] in Computer Science, I knew that I wanted to create something to call my own. The motivational momentum I had from my experience was still fresh and I was looking for something to apply the new skills I had acquired. 

##### The Problem
The idea came to mind when I was turning in an essay for a class at college. There was a minor essay that had to be no more than 3 pages and after writing it all out I was 4 lines over. After hours of staring at the paper, I realized that I didn't want to cut any of my beautiful work. So naturally, I resorted to shrinking the font size and widening the margins, which made it look awkward. The process was tedious and some specific tricks that I wanted to access were hard to find, so I set out to build DocSizer to fix the issue for myself, and many others.

##### The Solution

DocSizer is a Google add-on that helps users with expanding and compressing their essay size with formatting tricks, and punctual changes. Although I lot of the functionality that uses formatting is already included in the Google Docs toolbar, some features are hard to use or find so DocSizer collects all the best tools for formatting right on a little sidebar. The Add-On also has unique features such as contraction editing, which will expand or retract your word contractions to resize your essay without changing any meaning.

Note: This tool only works with Google docs, since the Add-On is hosted only on Google's marketplace.

##### The Build Process

Google Apps Script was a lovely tool to stumble upon. They make it really easy to build and test your work right on their platform using their editor, and they have great documentation for their API and Google Apps Script in general. Since this was a minor project, I just used the code editor that is provided right in the project dashboard. I would not recommend this however, if you are looking to develop an expansive google add-on, as they are missing many functionalities such as error notifications and autocomplete. 

This project helped me practice Javascript and HTML/CSS for the first time on a small scale. Using some self-taught HTML, I was able to construct a basic sidebar layout that is clear and easy to use. Also, since the Apps Script documentation was well maintained the javascript itself was easy to implement.

##### What I learned from this project

Since this was my first solo project, I learned many things about software development. When you are working with new technologies, it is very important to have good documentation available so that you don't waste time and effort. The Apps Script documentation saved me many hours of frustrating debugging and head-scratching. 

Patience is another key component in working on software. I learned early on that getting frustrated and taking shortcuts with your code can end up badly. Not seeing the solution on Stack Overflow right away doesn't mean that you should give up on the code outline that you are trying to follow. A couple hours of patience that lead to the correct way of doing things can help you a lot in the long run. 

Most importantly though, I realized that building DocSizer was fulfilling and fun for me. Being able to contribute to society with my work had a great sense of accomplishment and knowing that I liked that kind of work has me excited for what's to come.
