 There's always a certain level of suspense when diving into something new. When I first set out to look for internships during the turn of 2016, I didn't know what to expect. Starting college and declaring a major is one thing, but putting your money where your mouth is and working out in the field is another. But what I knew was that I wanted to see what I was working towards. What was it going to be like working 40 hours a week in an office? Would I be able to contribute to the company and make an impact with the knowledge I had? These were all questions I was dying to answer. 

 When I first stepped into the <a href="https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/" target="_blank">Plug and Play</a> Startup Accelerator for my first interview, it was suddenly all so real. Seeing people so hard at work to achieve their dreams is incredibly inspiring. Its hard to understand what you're really working towards until you see it yourself. 

 My experience at <a href="http://www.contextsmith.com/" target="_blank">ContextSmith</a> was really the catalyst of my passion for computer science. As the only intern, I was able to talk to the other workers and observe the true grind of a Silicon Valley startup. I learned a lot of things about work ethic, office culture, and the workflow process. This was my first time in a non-sports environment where everyone was working together towards an ulitmate goal. The ContextSmith product is an account-based sales platform designed to simplify and streamline the sales process. The platform can take salesforce data, company-wide calendar info, and contact info to make sales easier. Working with them helped me appreciate the education I was receiving and drove me forward towards my future goals in the computer science industry.

 As a Software QA Intern, I was first delegated to testing the platform manually. As one might imagine, hours and hours of clicking and trying to "break" the product was interesting at first, but it got boring quick. Within a couple weeks, I was already looking into a way to automate the process. The company was pushing out more and more features, and unit tests needed to be put into place to save precious time and prevent the risk of bugs or worse. 

 Now there is a large difference between working on and implementing a feature for your own school project, and creating a testing infastructure that is the one of the only things standing in the way of a system-wide failure. The large jump between the school exp. and the work exp. in computer science was becoming all the more apparent. In the field your work matters and makes an impact on the product, and the product is the baby of all the workers at the company. This fact is increased tenfold with early stage startups. So naturally, when learning and implementing the <a href="https://www.seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank">Selenium</a> testing framework there was a feeling of unease.

 One thing that education helps with is the ability to teach you how to learn. I found out early on that once I knew what my task was, learning and implementing something was not as hard as it might have seemed. So after a week or two, I was able to contruct a basic testing framework for the homepage. And after another week, I was done writing tests to run a typical user login and sign up flow. At the end of the internship, it was safe to say that I was knowledgable about the main processes of the Selenium testing framework, and unit testing in general. This brought me to the realization that nothing is out of my technical reach as long as I put my mind to it. It turns out that hours and hours of studying mitochondria wasn't useless after all.
