1. The Problem
2. Our Solution
3. Obstacles
This past weekend, I had the priviledge to compete in the 2019 Intuit Hackathon. First and foremost, I'd like to thank Intuit for hosting such a well-organized event. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was inspiring. With over 35 teams and around 220 developers, coming into this years hackathon I would have never imagined placing at such an event.

The theme was "create a brand NEW solution that saves a small business time or money". At hackathons like this, it seems to me like the most important thing is to have a good idea, and just be a good enough developer to represent that idea to the judges elegantly. That means that having a great idea for a solution is imperative to doing well in a hackathon like this. So after throwing around some ideas with our team at the dinner table, we decided on what we were going to build that weekend: A market-based platform for freelance workers to connect with small businesses for just-in-time employment.

One of the problems that small businesses have is understaffing for very short time periods. For example, a company with a small amount of workers might not be able to find a substitute for a sick employee, or might not be able to keep up with a large flow of customers during a black friday event. Our solution, Jitsy(Just-In-Time-Staffing), allowed companies with temporary employment issues fill those positions with workers in the area that have a pre-verified backround, and matching skills.

It's easy to think of a few issues with this solution. One of the biggest issues is training time and onboarding a new worker in time for an event. Our solution was having verified "skills" such as "lifeguard certificate", or "cashier", so that it was easier to match workers with jobs that they are already trained for. This allows for businesses to onbaord new workers at a much faster pace. 
Another problem was being able to trust these workers with work at a small business. Again, our solution was verification, but with reviews from prior employers. Also, each worker would have a recorded "interview" video, which would give employers a preview of what that person is like.
