This past weekend, I had the privilege to compete in the 2019 Intuit Hackathon. First and foremost, I'd like to thank Intuit for hosting such a well-organized event. The staff was friendly/accommodating and the atmosphere was inspiring. With over 35 teams and around 220 developers, coming into this year's hackathon I would have never imagined placing at such an event.

##### The Problem
The theme was to "create a brand NEW solution that saves a small business time or money". At hackathons like this, it seems to me that the most important thing is to have a good idea, and just be a good enough developer to be able to represent that idea to the judges elegantly. That means that having a great idea for a solution is imperative to doing well in a hackathon like this. So after throwing around some ideas with our team at the dinner table, we decided on what we were going to build that weekend: A market-based platform for freelance workers to connect with small businesses for just-in-time employment.

##### Our Solution
One of the problems that small businesses have is understaffing for very short time periods. For example, a company with a small number of workers might not be able to find a substitute for a sick employee, or might not be able to keep up with a large flow of customers during a Black Friday event. Our solution, Jitsy(Just-In-Time-Staffing), allowed companies with temporary employment issues fill those positions with workers in the area that have a pre-verified background, and matching skills.

##### Obstacles
It's easy to think of a few issues with this solution. One of the biggest issues is training time and onboarding a new worker in time for an event. Our solution was having verified "skills" such as "lifeguard certificate", or "cashier", so that it was easier to match workers with jobs that they are already trained for. This allows businesses to onboard new workers at a much faster pace.

Another problem was being able to trust these workers with work at a small business. Our solution was a multitude of features which involved verification, and face-to-face interaction through our platform. Each worker profile has reviews from prior business work, and a pre-recorded "interview" video, which would give employers a preview of what that person is like. Businesses can also video-call applicants directly through the Jitsy platform to serve as a quick interview or screening.

##### The Stack/My Role
It can be hard to work on a single product during a hackathon especially when a team has different stack experiences in web development. While some of us had tons of experience with frontend development, others were just getting started. Luckily we were able to split up the work into frontend, backend, API integration, and design. We split it up like this because it is easy to work on each of these individually without relying on the work of others.

My role was to create all the API endpoints using Flask(python), and connect the SQLite database to handle the traffic from job postings and workers. Flask made it easy to create endpoints and hooked up seamlessly with SQLite using the SQLAlchemy package. 

The full tech stack for our application was React, Flask(Python) and SQLite.  After 30 hours of grueling(but fun) development, we wrapped up the frontend development and were ready for presentation.

##### Securing 2nd Place
As I mentioned earlier, it was most important to give a pitch that represented our idea well. With only 3 minutes to do so, we had to chop down a lot of what we wanted to show. One of the things we did was hard-coding a lot of the demo for our pitch to make things less variable, and more reliable. This allowed us to be quicker during the demo and not have to wait for requests to go through. 

It was really nerving to step up onto the stage to present our idea that we had worked so hard to build. We knew that we had a decent shot, but with 35 other teams presenting that day, we didn't know what to expect. The presentation went by fast, and before I knew it, our microphone was cut and we were ushered off the stage. We were all scared for the results, we had put everything on the table.

When our name was announced, I couldn't believe it. I had never imagined placing at such an event, with so many experienced developers and teams competing. It's nice to know that with a great team and idea, anything can happen.
