 My name is Collin Hurst and I'm a Computer Science Major at UCSC. I like to build and work in the Computer Science industry because of the challenges it presents and the problems that I am able to solve for people. My ultimate goal is to provide products and solutions that help people and the environment as a whole. 

Outside of Computer Science I'm a climber, foodie, drawer, sports enthusiast, and much more. Check out my social media linked in the footer to check out what I'm doing/have done. Thanks for visiting my Site!
